<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Fortesa Reqica and I'm excited to begin my journey as a web developer. While I may not have much professional experience yet, I am passionate about coding and eager to learn more.

  I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently learning more advanced concepts such as responsive design, server-side scripting, and database management. I'm also familiar with popular front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js.
  
  I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills. I enjoy working on personal projects, participating in coding challenges and hackathons, and collaborating with other developers to learn from their experiences.
  
  I understand that web development is a constantly evolving field, and I am committed to keeping up with the latest technologies and best practices. I am a quick learner, detail-oriented, and always strive to produce clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
  
  When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about the latest web development trends, experimenting with new programming languages and tools, or engaging in outdoor activities.
  
  I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to contributing my skills to a team of like-minded professionals. Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and I hope to have the opportunity to work with you in the future..</p>
